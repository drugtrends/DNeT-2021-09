            <li>27 cryptomarkets were monitored in the period from 4th October 2018 to 30th September 2021. Nine of these markets closed - Dream Market, Empire, Apollon, Tochka, DarkBay, Berlusconi, Wall Street, Cryptonia and CGMC - while the other 18 remained open as at the end of September 2021.</li>
            <li>There were 3,125,029 listings in total over the monitoring period, comprising 1,893,053 listings in the first period between 1st October 2018 and 13th Feb 2020 and 1,231,976 listings in the second period between 4th February 2021 and 30th September 2021.
